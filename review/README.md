Going to focus on explaning these concepts and creating examples for each to have a resource to use for studying and focus time.

➤ Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) isn't about doing 3500 questions.
You just need to understand the building blocks:
→ Arrays
→ Linked Lists
→ Stacks & Queues
→ Hashmaps
→ Heaps
→ Trees
→ Graphs
→ Tries
→ Matrices

And the key patterns:
→ Two Pointers
→ Sliding Window
→ Binary Search
→ Recursion
→ Basic Dynamic Programming

When the patterns click, the questions stop feeling like magic tricks.

Aim for 60–90 minutes/day.
Consistency > intensity.

➤ System design isn't about memorising diagrams
You just need to focus on these core fundamentals:
→ API Design: rate limiting, versioning, REST basics
→ Databases: SQL vs NoSQL, indexes, transactions, strong vs eventual consistency
→ Caching
→ Scalability: Horizontal vs Vertical scaling, Load balancing, CDNs
→ Queues & async processing
→ Sharding & replication
→ Failure handling & retries
→ Observability (logs, metrics, tracing)

This isn't an exhaustive list, but these pillars should carry you through most rounds.
Remember, your reasoning matters more than your drawing skills.

➤ Behavioural interviews aren't less important than technical interviews
Prepare STAR stories about:
→ Ownership
→ Customer Obsession
→ Conflict
→ Ambiguity
→ Learning something quickly
→ Leading without authority
